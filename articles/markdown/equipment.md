# Equipment and software I use

## Hardware
I built a desktop computer back in 2017. So far I have managed to upgrade it quite a bit and since I got sick from all the consoomerism, I do not plan to upgrade my desktop computer anytime soon.  
The specs are following:  

### Processor
I use AMD Ryzen 1600. I would say it is quite good CPU for my purposes. I might even consider this CPU as AMD's i5 2500k, in terms of its longetivity. That being said this CPU is still using x86 architecture,
which is heavily compromised by glowniggers, by having essentially a built in [flawed backdoor](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/design-flaws-backdoors-amd-ryzen,36657.html), which not only could be used by glowniggers, 
but also by random black-hat hackers, whenever a new exploit is found.

### Graphics card
My desktop has not one, but two graphics cards. One is Nvidia GTX 1070TI and the other one is AMD Rx 480. The reason for two completely different graphics cards is actually quite simple. Since I sometimes setup virtual machines
for different purposes, I'd like to have near native graphics performance. For this purpose I do PCI passthrough and in order to do PCI passthrough I must isolate secondary graphics card from the host machine completely. The secondary
graphics card in my case being AMD Rx 480. For more information about isolating graphics card and setting up PCI passthrough for the vm, check out this Arch wiki [article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF)  

### Memory
I have a good amount of 32GB of memory (mainly because of my virtual machine autism).

### Storage devices
For root file system I use a 500GB ssd, which I also use to contain EFI partition and swap space. I also have one 1TB hard drive, which has 90% of its storage capacity used most of the time. To combat this issue I also have
two 2TB hard drives in raid. This provides me some additional storage space that is much needed in my case.


## Software
When it comes to software I try to mostly avoid proprietary crap (or isolate it in virtual machine and use it that way if really needed). The only bad exception, when I really need to use proprietary software is when I need to install
Nvidia drivers, because Nvidia is a Apple of GPU manifacturers that hates free software.

### Operating system
I use Void Linux, which is completely independent Linux distribution. Some reasons why I chose Void Linux in particular can be following: no systemd, very minimal installation, up to date packages and
decent selection of packages in package manager. I have also used other distributions in the past such as Debian, Arch, Gentoo and even Ubuntu at some point. As much as I can tell, there is not much difference 
between distros, other than the packages management system, init system and the amount of bloat that comes preinstalled with clean installation.

### Window manager
I use my own configuration of suckless's dwm alongside with my own configuration of dmenu. In addition I always set the GTK theme as Chicago95 for better visual compatibility with the status bar and GTK ui elements. I haven't really found any 
good QT themes that would look uniform with Chicago95, but I don't really care either since I don't really use programs that use QT anyways. My dwm configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/inugami-dev64/dwm).

### Terminal emulator
As for the terminal emulator of my choice, I chose suckless's st. It does all that it needs to do and it is quite customisable. My custom st build can be found at following [link](https://github.com/inugami-dev64/st).

### Media player
I use mpv for listening to music and consooming videos locally or from the internet using youtube-dl. Mpv is literally the best media player out there. It is quite lightweight (compared to vlc for example), it is extensible with userscripts,
it has decent selection of commandline options and most importantly it is very keyboard friendly media player indeed.

### Web browser
I use Firefox ESR with hardened configuration, since I despise Chromium based browsers. That being said Firefox is still quite shit browser out of the box for the following reasons: the amount of telemetry it sends back home, useless features such as pocket, 
Goolag as its default search engine, gimped down user interface, no adblocking by default, and the leftist agenda that Mozilla is propagating. However once the tweaking part is done it is quite a good browser. If the tweaking is too much I can recommend more
sane fork of Firefox called [Librewolf](https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/). It has all the same functionality as regular Firefox, but without telemetry, with more private search engine providers by default and with uBlock origin preinstalled.

### Text editor
I use Neovim for text editing, which is essentially just a community driven fork of Vim, which onto itself is a fork of old unix based text editor called Vi. Vim is a completely different world onto itself and its keybindings are really nice to use, once 
you master the Vim wizardry. My init.vim (vimrc for Neovim) can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/inugami-dev64/2be6af9deddbcb1d0f0febb2e2eaf274/raw/d9981e9aaa39ba77c801f5197d1aeab4d74e2221/.vimrc)

### Mail client
I use Thunderbird, since I am lazy and it just werksÂ®. It's not great email client, since it is quite bloated by using Mozilla's gecko engine, but it is good enough for my purposes. If you'd like a CLI mail client use something like mutt instead.

### PDF viewer
For PDF viewer I use mupdf. It does what it is supposed to do, show the PDF file. That being said mupdf does not have many fancy features including printing capability, but that can be done using lpr anyways.

### Image viewer
I use feh for image viewing. It supports most of the image formats (except animated gifs) and can be used to set wallpapers for X11.

### Image manipulation (read: meme manipulation program)
GIMP, it is decent enough.

### Torrent client
For torrenting stuff, I use transmission-cli. It is probably the most basic bitch choice (along with qbittorrent), but it works and is not too bloated.

### Typesetting
For typesetting I use LaTex because all cool kids use it, so I must as well. I like Latex, since it allows to create fancy mathematical equations, automatic paragraph numbering, automatic ToC generation and decent bibliography management. 
Also Latex allows to create a correctly formated documents with ease. Which means that I can just focus on writing the document and not having to worry about formating (assuming that I have necessary template created).

### Presentations
Whenever I need to create a presentation I just write a Markdown file, then use pandoc to convert the markdown file into Latex using Beamer class and finally compile the Latex file into PDF. It is really easy to do and much better than having
to use something like Libreoffice or even worse Google slides.

### Spreadsheets
For spreadsheets, I use Libreoffice calc, because I have Libreoffice installed anyways for opening word documents, when needed.
