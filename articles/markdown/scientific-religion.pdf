Pseudoscience is a new religion
Ever since the so called Covid-19 pandemic, it has become more and more
apparent that the absence of religion from mainstream society causes the general
populus to find alternative paths for defining their morales. Whenever some
ridiculously extreme measure is taken for the sake of ¿public safety¿, it seems
that there is almost always some community of soy latte sipping beta-males
defending these dystopian measures and it certainly seems as a result that the
society becomes even more polarised due to that.
Once there is enough ignorant people that blindly believe in anything that the
scientific establishment presents them, it becomes surprisingly easy for science
institutions and mainstream media to present lies to them, without facing any
serious consequences, assuming that all pseudoscience critisisers would be either
socially or physically exterminated. This onto itself creates a whole new level of
religion for those that believe in the current establishment and its prosperous
future. They become increasingly aware of the fact, how the so called dissidents
are being exterminated and if they can present themselves as being supporters
of the regime, they might expect some kind on prosperity for their own benefit.
This prosperity for them is extremely unlikely to happen, because the estab-
lishment would only see these kinds of people as useful idiots, since society as a
whole is very large and finding someone to blame for ones problems is surpisingly
easy task to do. This task can be given to those useful idiots to keep them busy,
while never actually presenting these people any kind of prosperity that they
were once promised with. Let¿s assume that the problem of handling dissidents
becomes a non-issue in this fictional society. In this case the establishment can
just launch another clever propaganda campain to transform its followers into
believing some other non-existing issue to keep useful idiots busy.

Implicit indoctrination from the example of Covid-19 time-
line
In the times of stability and prosperity, it becomes quite di¿icult to differentiate
potentially indoctrinateable people from those whose moral values are nothing

more than a current mainstream trend. In order to separate people and create
strong polarisation in society an artificially inflated crisis can be used for that
purpose perfectly. This kind of polarisation helps the new religion to separate
infidels from believers and create this kind of strong morale on both sides to
fight against each other. Now, in order for this new social polarisation and the
creation of the religion to be successful a mass indoctrination campain needs to
be launched targeting mainly people, whose moral values are nothing more than
a current mainstream trend, since these kinds of people are usually the easiest
followers to gain. The successful indoctrination process of pseudoscience from
the example of Covid-19 timeline is explained below.

Step 1: Artificially create and inflate a large-scale unsolveable prob-
lem for the humanity to face
Large-scale problem in this case is the Sars-Cov2 virus itself, but in reality any
kind of virus would be a good choice for this step. This problem could not only
be a healthcare related problem, but in also literally any other problem that
can be derived from the consequences of the current human civilisation. For
example the climate change, income inequality, sexual minority rights, racial
minority rights, migrant rights, etc.
