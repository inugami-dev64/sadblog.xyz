# My searx instance has changed subdomains

So if you were using my searx instance and it suddenly stopped working, don't smash your 
head into the wall like it's the end of the world. I just changed the subdomains in server's 
nginx config to be more straight forward. What used to be `https://sadblog.xyz/searx` is now
`https://searx.sadblog.xyz`. Just change your search engine URL correspondingly and you are good to go.
