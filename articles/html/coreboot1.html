                <p>My friend recently gave me a T420 for cleaning and since I personally also own a T420 as well I asked him, if he would like to get it corebooted. He agreed on that. Once I recieved the Thinkpad it was in a quite rough condition: scratches on the screen, awful anime stickers on the back, nasty keyboard, broken plastics etc.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Firstly I attempted to remove all the stickers that I could get and after rubbing the back of the screen with some isopropyl alcohol for about 10 minutes, I managed to clean off most of the sticker glue and other nastiness from it. The result of this cleaning looks like this:</p>

                <p>After some outer cleaning I attempted to proceed with the usual corebooting process. The first step of corebooting any machine is to update the vendor bios to the latest version, since the original bios image is required for extracting firmware blobs. After trying to access the bios, I was prompted with the following screen:</p>

                </figure>
                <p>It seems that the bios was locked after all, so I asked my friend to provide me the password, but he had forgotten it. After hearing that I decided to hack into bios instead. I did some research and found that it is actually possible to bypass the password by shorting two pins on the bios security EEPROM chip. In my case it was the PCO8A chip on the motherboard. The bios security EEPROM should be located on the side of the motherboard where CPU socket is not located. Once the security chip is located you should identify SCL and SDA pins. Usually they should be pins 5 and six 6 (circled on the picture below)</p>

                <p>Now you should reassemble the display, power connector, keyboard, CMOS, memory, cpu and heatsink back together because now comes the fun part of actually hacking into bios. Finally connect the power connector to the charger and you should have similar setup:</p>

                <p>Take some small conductive object, such as a flat-head screwdriver and follow the following instructions (assuming that UEFI bios is used):</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Turn on the computer</li>
                <li>Once the screen turns on immideately short the SCL and SDA pins together</li>
                <li>Press F1 repeatedly</li>
                <li>If the password prompt comes up, try these steps again</li>
                <li>If you get into bios successfully, you can navigate to Security -&gt; Supervisor password and disable or add new bios password</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now you should have successfully breached bios security measures and gained access to bios settings once again.</p>
