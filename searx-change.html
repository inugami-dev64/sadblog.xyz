                <p>So if you were using my searx instance and it suddenly stopped working, don’t smash your head into the wall like it’s the end of the world. I just changed the subdomains in server’s nginx config to be more straight forward. What used to be <code>https://sadblog.xyz/searx</code> is now <code>https://searx.sadblog.xyz</code>. Just change your search engine URL correspondingly and you are good to go.</p>
